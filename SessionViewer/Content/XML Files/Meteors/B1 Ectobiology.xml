  <Description>Ectobiology labs are laboratories located in one of the many asteroids in the Veil, and presumably exist in each session of Sburb. They are accessed through a number of transportalizers across the seperate Planets.  They contain everything needed to preform Ectobiology, including a Sburb computer terminal, as in unscratched sessions one player will have to take care of actually creating themselves and their teammates through ectobiology.</Description>
