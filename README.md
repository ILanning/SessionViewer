## Session Viewer

A recently-revamped project for viewing game worlds from the webcomic Homestuck.  All objects and events in these worlds are defined via XML, allowing users to create their own.  Sample worlds from the comic's canon are included by default. 

### Build Process

*Note: This project has only been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10, with builds done via Visual Studio 2015.*

To build this yourself:

* Download and install [Monogame 3.6](http://www.monogame.net/2017/03/01/monogame-3-6/).
* Use `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ILanning/SessionViewer.git` to pull the project and its submodule.
* Download the image asset pack [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3Yb36HM_ZN9bjJEdWRHQjFQeUk), then unzip its contents into the existing SessionViewer/Content directory.
* At this point, the project should be useable!
